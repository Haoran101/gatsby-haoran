# Automatic Review System based on Deep Neural network

This project is to create an automatic review system over user taken images. My group is working on the simplest encoder-decoder model, 
where the encoder is achieved by Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and decoder is achieved by Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN).\
The project includes both *computer vision* (CV) and *natual language processing* (NLP) disciplines.

## Key Concepts
- [Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolutional_neural_network)
- [InceptionV3 Feature](https://keras.io/api/applications/inceptionv3/)
- [Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recurrent_neural_network)
- [Long short-term memory (LSTM)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_short-term_memory)
- [GloVe Embeddings](https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/)

## Key Technology Takeaways
- Python
- Pandas, Numpy
- PyTorch, Keras
- Use of GPU 
- Linux System

## Contribution

The project was completed by a group of 7 members, who were divided into 3 teams and took charge of training different models to compare.Team A, where I was leading 3 members, worked on an encoder-decoder architecture model without attention mechanism.
I was responsible for most of data processing, programming and model tuning tasks for my team.
